Trophic Herds changes herbivore behavior to be much more natural, with more realistic animal behavior in Minecraft Paper servers. Cows, sheep, pigs, rabbits, chickens self-gather in herds or flocks, grazing and wandering throughout the day. At night, the herd pulls close for protection.

Herbivores no longer ignore others; now they run from players, villagers, and hostile mobs; the reproduce on their own, if they have access to open grassland and clean water. They have full life cycles - herds have a certain size to which they grow, and adult herd members are born, they live, then die of old age.

This plugin helps nerf mob farms; now players must give animals space or they won't breed. It takes away player breeding, making animal farming more natural and less focused on game mechanics.
